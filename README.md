## 🚀 Publishing a New Topic

Follow these steps to publish a new topic:

1. **Create Your Topic Folder:**
   - Navigate to `src/data/topics/`.
   - Copy the `python` folder (template) and rename it to your topic name.

2. **Update Content Files:**
   - Inside your new topic folder:
     - Edit `TopicData.js` to include details like chapters, topics, and links for your topic.
     - In the main `.jsx` file (e.g., `[YourTopicName]Topics.jsx`), import and organize each topic component.

3. **Organize Chapters:**
   - Use the `contents` folder to create a new folder for each chapter, named by chapter title.
   - Place chapter-specific content (component) inside these folders.

4. **Commit and Document:**
   - Add a `README.md` (like this one!) to your topic folder to explain its structure and contents.
   - Commit your changes and push to the repository.
