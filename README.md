## Guideline for Publishing a Topic

### Step 1: Navigate to the Data Folder 📁
This folder contains all the data related to topics and their contents. Inside this folder, you will find three subfolders:

1. **assets**: Store images related to the topic or its content here. 🖼️
2. **contents**: This folder contains a JavaScript file that must follow the naming convention `<topic_name>topic.js`. 📄
3. **topics**: Here, you will find a JavaScript file that includes information about all available topics on the site. 📚

### Step 2: Use the Template for New Topics 🛠️
A pre-made component, `PythonTopic.jsx`, is provided as a template to display content. This file depends on the `<topic_name>topic.js` file located in `./contents/<topic>topic`. You can add new topics and explanations using this template. 

**Note**: Familiarity with HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap is required to edit the template. The rest of the UI will be managed by our team. 🎨

### Step 3: Submit Your Changes ✔️
After adding your topic and successfully testing it, please open a pull request on the **dev** branch to contribute your work. 📝
